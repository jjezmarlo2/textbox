		<p>To install Textbox 3.0, you have to do some extra things.</p>
		<p>First, make a new txt file and call it 'colors.txt'. <br>
		Then copy 'white black' into the file for as many passwords as there are. <br>
		Make sure each 'white black' is on a new line, so the program has an easier time reading it!</p>
